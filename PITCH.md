# SecuredT - 3-Minute Pitch

## "PayPal for the Unbanked, Built on Mantle"

---

## THE PROBLEM (60 seconds)

### The $420 Billion Crisis

**$420 billion.** That's Africa's trade finance gap - the largest in the world. Every day, millions of freelancers, SMEs, and entrepreneurs lose money because there's no trustworthy way to transact across borders.

### Amara's Story

*Amara is a 24-year-old graphic designer from Lagos, Nigeria. Last month, she completed a $500 logo design project for a client in the UK. She waited. And waited. Three weeks later - nothing. No payment. No response. Her rent was due.*

**This is not just Amara's story. This is the story of 50 million African freelancers.**

### The Trust Crisis in African Commerce

- **$15 billion** lost annually to payment fraud and non-payment in Africa
- **67%** of African freelancers have been scammed at least once
- **Average wait time**: 45-90 days for international payments
- **The unbanked**: 57% of Sub-Saharan Africans lack access to traditional banking

### Why Traditional Solutions Fail

| Problem | PayPal's Limitation |
|---------|-------------------|
| Not available in 30+ African countries | Geographic restrictions |
| High fees (4-5% + currency conversion) | Expensive for small transactions |
| Account freezes without warning | Centralized control |
| No protection for service providers | Buyer-centric disputes |
| Money sits idle during disputes | Zero yield on escrow |

**The gap**: There's no trustless, accessible payment protection for the world's fastest-growing freelance economy.

---

## WHY NOW? The Perfect Storm

| Trend | What's Happening | Why It Matters |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **PayPal's Failure** | After 20 years of restricting African users, PayPal is trying to return in 2026 - but trust is shattered | Africans need alternatives they control |
| **Stablecoin Adoption** | 43% of Sub-Saharan Africa's crypto volume is stablecoins (2024) | Users are ready for crypto payments |
| **AfCFTA Activation** | African Continental Free Trade Area is creating $3.4T integrated market | Cross-border trade is exploding |
| **RWA Narrative** | Real World Assets are the #1 crypto trend for 2025 | Invoice NFTs are perfectly positioned |
| **Mobile-First Continent** | 70% of Africa's internet is mobile; M-Pesa processes $300B/year | Decentralized mobile finance works here |

**The timing has never been better.**

## THE SOLUTION: SecuredT (60 seconds)

### "What if PayPal was built for Africa, on blockchain?"

SecuredT is a **decentralized escrow and invoice factoring platform** built on Mantle Network, bringing PayPal-style protection to the 1.4 billion people who need it most.

### Core Features

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Smart Escrow** | Funds locked until work approved | No more "send work first, pray later" |
| **Invoice NFTs** | Tokenize invoices as tradable assets | Get paid NOW, not in 90 days |
| **Yield Generation** | Earn 7.2% APY on escrow via mETH | Your money works while it waits |

### The Invoice Factoring Revolution

**Scenario**: Amara has a $5,000 invoice due in 30 days, but she needs money NOW for equipment.

1. She lists her invoice NFT at 10% discount ($4,500)
2. An investor buys it instantly
3. Amara gets $4,500 today
4. Investor receives $5,000 when escrow releases (11% profit, ~130% APR)

**Everyone wins. No banks. No borders. No BS.**

## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### What Happens When Things Go Wrong?
